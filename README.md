It's a prototype of an RPG game with a simple square map. 

<!--- SCREENSHOT -->

The player is steering his character from a 3D person view using <kbd>arrows</kbd> or <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>A</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd>, <kbd>D</kbd> along with a <kbd>mouse</kbd> to rotate the camera. 

<!--- SCREENSHOT -->

He has to collect three spawned spheres. The colors of these spheres are one of three possible colors (red, green, yellow) randomly selected. When players collect them they spawn again with the new random position in the map scope. A number of selected spheres is counting and can be displayed in the console by pressing the I key. 

<!--- SCREENSHOT -->

There is a short cutscene when the player lowers the lever. An elevation extends from the wall and the camera is changing its position smoothly.
